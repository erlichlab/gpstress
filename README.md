src

The src folder contains the code to run the tasks (in task) and also code that will generate the main figures (in analysis.).

data

The data folder contains anonymized choice and stress data from our subjects.

figs

The figures folder contains high quality PDFs of the individual delay discounting fits (DS and DW sessions) and the individual risk fits (figures S2-S4). Also, if you run the src/analysis/master.m script (and master.Rmd after uncommenting) it will put figures in this folder.
