### code

The `src` folder contains the code to run the tasks (in task) and also code that will generate the main figures (in analysis).

### data

The `data` folder contains anonymized choice and stress data from our subjects.

### figures

The `figs` folder contains high quality PDFs of the individual delay discounting fits (sessions 1 \& 2, and session 3; figures S2 and S3, respectively). Also, if you run the src/analysis/master.m script (and master.Rmd after uncommenting) it will put figures in this folder.
